# About

This project is a simple chat system using python sockets. I made it mostly just as a way to learn how they work. It allows for peer to peer chat between a server and client user.


# Requirements

Python 3

Tkinter


# Usage

One user starts the server program (messserver.py), once this is started, another user starts the client program (messclient.py). The client user should put in the IP address of the server user when prompted. It will then connect and allow users to exchange messages.
